          general informational purposes only. While we strive to offer accurate
          and up-to-date guidance, gardening and plant care involve various

          Climate and Location Considerations: Different plants thrive in
          different climates and environments. This application provides general
          information, but it is essential to consider your local climate, soil

          decisions and actions. Follow recommended practices for watering,
          fertilizing, and pest control, but be mindful of the unique needs of
          your plants. Overwatering, under-watering, and other care mistakes can
          impact plant health.
